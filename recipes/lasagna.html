    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups finely diced invisible space bird meat (previously captured with advanced energy nets)</li>
        <li>1 cup stardust-infused cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 cup celestial vegetable medley (cosmic carrots, interstellar spinach, and nebula onions), finely chopped</li>
        <li>9 sheets of cosmic pasta (handcrafted by starlight)</li>
        <li>2 cups ethereal cream sauce (harvested from the cosmic rivers of flavor)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon gravitational seasoning (for that captivating taste)</li>
        <li>Interdimensional olive oil (as needed)</li>
        <li>A pinch of meteoric salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your warp oven to 375 degrees Quark (our unit of temperature measurement).</li>
        <li>In a dimension-spanning skillet, heat a drizzle of interdimensional olive oil. Saut√© the celestial vegetable medley until it shimmers with vibrant hues.</li>
        <li>Add the diced invisible space bird meat and cook until it transcends to a succulent texture. Sprinkle the gravitational seasoning to infuse the dish with otherworldly aromas.</li>
        <li>Prepare the ethereal cream sauce by mixing stardust-infused cheese with a dash of cosmic cream. Let the flavors harmonize until the mixture resonates with satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Layer the bottom of a warp-proof lasagna dish with a thin veil of the ethereal cream sauce. Place three sheets of cosmic pasta, each soaked in the sauce for a taste beyond dimensions.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the invisible space bird and celestial vegetable mixture over the pasta, ensuring an even cosmic distribution.</li>
        <li>Repeat the pasta, sauce, and invisible space bird layers, creating a symphony of textures and flavors that defy ordinary culinary experiences.</li>
        <li>Complete the journey with a final layer of pasta, crowned with the remaining ethereal cream sauce and a sprinkle of stardust-infused cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the warp oven for approximately 30 minutes, or until the lasagna reaches a state of sublime golden-brown resonance.</li>
        <li>Allow the flavors to meld in the cosmic matrix for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with a sprinkle of meteoric salt to elevate the taste to transcendental heights.</li>
    </ol>
